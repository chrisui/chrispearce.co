        <p>
          Having held traditional "designer", "software engineer" and "product
          manager" roles upto director level over my career I am able to lead

          <h4>Ben Peters, VP Product, Five AI</h4>
          <p>
            Chris is a unique talent; excelling as a developer, as a product
            manager and as a product designer. He brought his skills to bear for
            us at Five in all three areas, bringing some of these functions from
            zero to one, building out the processes and the team as he went.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's a jibe often levelled at product managers that when they
            leave engineering to become product managers, the average capability
            in both teams goes up. This was never more true than in Chris's
            case, but purely because of the focus he brought to those
            engineering teams by stepping up to run Product for them. Chris
            helped his teams understand the customers they were building for and
            the user experience that would engage them. He lead on developing
            solid product discovery processes and brought his colleagues along
            with him. When teams were on-fire, he figured out how to have them
            collaborate better and how to manage demanding stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>If you can hire him, you should.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Peter Johnston, CEO, Kalo</h4>
          <p>
            Chris is a machine - I would rehire him in a second. He not only has
            the ability to get things done and shipped incredibly efficiently,
            he does so while considering the bigger picture. Chris is incredibly
            versatile too, I was always confident he would think like a product
            person, not just an engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I couldn't recommend him higher. He built Kalo's platform to what it
            is today.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Adam Neilson, CTO, HealthUnlocked</h4>
          <p>
            Rarely have I come across such a talented front-end dev as Chris.
            He's phenomenally good at making complex projects look simple and
            difficult schedules achievable with an unparalleled command of his
            domain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Definitely a welcome member of my dream team to conquer the World!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Jaime Agudo, Developer, HealthUnlocked</h4>
          <p>
            Chris is a kind of front-end evangelist, he master Javascript, CSS
            compilers and HTML swimming among the whole stack like fish into the
            water. Chris knows all the cutting edge stuff as the old tools and
            which to choose for each job. Furthermore, he is able to
            destructurate any framework into bricks to build a new one getting a
            product which is much greater than the mere sum of the parts.
          </p>
          <p>You can definitely rely on him to lead the development.</p>

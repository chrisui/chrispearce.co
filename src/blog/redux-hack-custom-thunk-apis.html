        makes action creators isolated and easily testable.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the first features you come across when working with
        <a href="http://redux.js.org">Redux</a> is the concept of an "Action
        Creator". An Action Creator is simply a function which will return an
        "Action" (an object describing something <em>to happen</em> or
        <em>has happened</em>). These Action Creators allow us to reduce
        boilerplate and repetition across our codebase - instead of calling
        <code>dispatch(action)</code> in our views we are isolating that logic
        into our Action Creators.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then comes the requirement of async flows. The most obvious activity
        being requesting data from a server. We now need to make our Action
        Creators handle this gracefully so how do we do it?
      </p>

      <p>
        The first thing we'll find suggested is using "Thunk Middleware". A
        Thunk in this sense is simply a function which is returned from our
        action creator. Redux middleware can then call this with some specific
        arguments allowing us to <em>act later</em> and importantly
        <em
          >with access to new references as provided by the thunk middleware</em
        >
        - in particular we can call <code>dispatch</code> again later.
      </p>

      <p>A basic example is as follows:</p>

      <pre><code>function asyncActionCreator() {
        return function thunk({dispatch}) {
          setTimeout(function doLater() {
            // dispatch an action *later*
            dispatch({type: PING});
          }, 500);
        }
      }
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        It should hopefully be relatively obvious how this would translate to
        doing something useful - going back to our example of fetching data how
        would we do that? Well we need some API Utils so let's just import them,
        right?
      </p>

      <pre><code>import api from 'api';
      
      function fetchUser(id) {
        return function thunk({dispatch}) {
          api.fetch(`users/${id}`).then(function(resp) {
            dispatch({type: USER_LOADED, user: resp.data});
          });
        }
      }
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        <em>Awesome!</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        But... How do we test this? We're now going to need to mock our
        dependencies. Ugh! This is a clear sign that our once nicely-isolated
        testable function has broken it's bounds in terms of dependencies. If
        your 'api' contains state here as well you're in for a bumpy ride.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where some people cry "thunks are cool but don't scale!",
        "thunk's can't be tested easily!" etc. but I tend to disagree still.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          We missed one important detail of the thunk middleware which would've
          allowed us to keep our action creators totally isolated. The
          arguments.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The standard thunk-middleware just injects an object with two properties
        - <code>getState</code> and <code>dispatch</code>. That's great but why
        don't we inject <em>more</em>!
      </p>

      <p>
        The thunk arguments provide the perfect point for injecting any outside
        dependencies in a manner you can test and isolate.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example our <code>fetchUser</code> action creator will now look
        something more like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code>export function fetchUser(id) {
        return ({api, dispatch}) =&gt;
          api.fetch(`users/${id}`).then(resp =&gt;
            dispatch({action: FETCH_USER, user: resp.body.data}));
      }
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        This function is now completely isolated and suddenly testing becomes
        <em>really</em> simple.
      </p>

      <pre><code>// And now testing is *super* easy - just inject away!
      it ('should hit correct endpoint', () =&gt; {
        const api = createMockApi([
          {
            test: 'users/1',
            resp: {data: {id: 1, type: 'user', name: 'Chris'}}
          }
        ]);
        const store = createMockAppStore({api});
      
        store.dispatch(fetchUser(1));
      
        expect(api.fetch.firstCall.args[0]).toEqual('users/1');
        expect(store.dispatch.firstCall.args[0]).toEqual(
          {action: FETCH_USER, user: {id: 1, type: 'user', name: 'Chris'}}
        );
      })
      </code></pre>

      <p>

        So now async thunk based action creators are easily testable and,
        providing you structure them correctly within the scope of your
        application (a topic for another time), they scale perfectly and are
        arguably more understandable, have less caveats and way less of an
        architectural restriction on the way you code than some of the other
        solutions out there.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Kalo we've been using custom thunk middleware since we picked up
        redux and, removing a little churn, have found them to be incredibly
        powerful as a simple concept (much like Redux itself!) so don't throw
        away thunks too quickly - they go a long way!

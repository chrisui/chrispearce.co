# Install for development

`npm install -g cssnano-cli html-minifier tinypng-cli autoprefixer-cli`

# Build

As we're just using github pages we build into the `docs/` folder for distribution. Pushes to `master` branch publish a new version.

Building is currently just very basic minification.

Run `./build.sh`!

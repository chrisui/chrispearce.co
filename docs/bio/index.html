From paper planes, to lego robots, fansites, marketplaces, game engines, music, social networks, business card editors, freelancer management platforms, visualisation platforms and autonomous driving simulation environments.<p>I form ideas and find the path of least resistance to execute and create.<li><h4>The Empathiser</h4><p>I credit a lot of my capability to have impact to a great deal of empathy. Whether calibrating communication to more efficiently develop ideas with others, to discovering products to have greatest impact on users and helping resolve conflicts between teams or individuals, the ability to reflect on a subject from the perspective of others is a critical trait.<p>I work with teams to deliver products users want, how they want.<li><h4>Calmly Chaotic</h4><p>The world is chaotic and business (especially startups) is no different. Being a generalist especially, I find there is always one too many plates to spin. However with a naturally calm and rational approach to breaking down problems I am able to weather storms and bring teams along with me without feeling like the world is on fire.<p>I help teams focus on what's important.</ul><div class="quote"><q>Chris is a unique talent; excelling as a developer, as a product manager and as a product designer.
